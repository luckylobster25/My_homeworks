In this homework, there was some missing code in both CSS and HTML page. 

I added a code to CSS style page to make it look nice when the screen went down in size. 
The code that was used was @media screen and (Max-width)

I also went through the HTML code page and saw broken code. When click on search engine optimization on the heading. 
It doesn't jump down to the imagine in the middle like the other two, Online Reputation management and Social Media Marketing. 
The reason for the code not working was the missing ID tag in the DIV for Search Engine Optimization. 
I added the id tag to the Div tag like the other two that have both id and class tag.  

I changed the Div to header to make it easier to read. Having too many div can be confusing.
