In this homework, there was some missing code in both CSS and HTML page. 

I added a code to CSS style page to make it look nice when the screen went down in size. 
The code that was used was @media screen and (Max-width)

I also went through the HTML code page and saw broken code. When click on search engine optimization on the heading. 

It doesn't jump down to the imagine in the middle like the other two, Online Reputation management and Social Media Marketing. 
The reason for the code not working was the missing ID tag in the DIV for Search Engine Optimization. 
I added the id tag to the Div tag like the other two that have both id and class tag.  

I changed the Div to header to make it easier to read. Having too many div can be confusing. 

I also change the div of the parent header to a nav. This will make it easier to read. 

The div that contain most of the content is changed to main. This will make it easier to understand that this is where most of the contents are at. 

There is a repeatative code of color which is change by creating a variable in the root and refence it back to it. This help me broswer load faster. 

One more div that was change is the div for the side information. It is changed to "aside".
